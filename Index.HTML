		This is a self portrait which represents who I want to be. As I brained stormed ideas on how I could represent myself in this piece, I thought about my taste. I have a very deep and eccentric taste. I like thing that are simple and to the point, and also things that are repetitive. The negative space is occupied by a black frame which connects to night. The spiral form in the center represents the moon because it is the only thing that can be clearly seen at night. This shape is layered on top of a “V” for “VILLN” (Villain). The reason the “V” is behind the moon is because the moon has two sides, the new moon, and the full moon. A Villain is portrayed as a evil, or dark individual. This infers that “V” belongs on the dark side of the moon. The “E” on the other hand represents “EAST” (every artist shall thrive). This is on the full side of the moon because this is the side of the moon that shines.
